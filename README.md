# Live-Financial-Dashboards
I built financial dashboards using Tableau Public and Power BI Online to analyze revenue, expenses, and key performance indicators.

## Assessment Note
I completed the Tarmeez Capital assessment by creating two interactive dashboards (Tableau Public & Power BI Online) with key financial metrics, stock trends, employee data, and insights. All work meets the assessment requirements and is submitted before the deadline.

### Overview
This is my first live financial dashboard developed using Tableau.
How is the company's financial performance evolving over time, and what are the main drivers of revenue, expenses, and profitability?

### Data Source 
The dataset used in this project was originally obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset), and then customized to suit the needs of this analysis. The source contains financial and organizational data for various companies, which has been refined and processed for consistency and relevance.
The dataset includes the following key fields:
- Date
- Company
- Division
- Region
- Revenue
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
- Operating Income
- Interest Expense
- Pre-Tax Income
- Income Tax
- Net Income
- Assets
  
Some values were adjusted or cleaned to ensure accuracy and compatibility with the analytical models and visualizations used throughout the project.


### Description
This project, “CFO Level Financial Metrics”, provides an executive financial overview based on historical company data. I analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) including Gross Margin, Operating Margin, and Return on Assets (ROA).
The analysis includes a comparison of this year versus last year, highlighting changes in profitability and operational efficiency. I also reviewed the Income Statement in detail, identifying key drivers of revenue, expenses, and net profit.
This overview delivers clear insights into the company’s financial performance and trends, helping to evaluate growth and efficiency at the CFO level.

### Key Insights
- Gross Margin improved to 40.4% (+0.6%), indicating stronger cost control and improved efficiency in managing production costs.
- Operating Margin increased to 20.5% (+0.6%), reflecting enhanced operational performance and better expense management.
- Return on Assets (ROA) slightly declined to 8.6% (-0.2%), suggesting a minor decrease in asset utilization efficiency.
- Revenue reached $64.4B, generating a Gross Profit of $26.0B and Net Income of $9.4B, demonstrating solid overall profitability.
- The Net Income trend shows noticeable improvement in several months compared to last year, highlighting positive financial momentum.
