# Live-Financial-Dashboard
I built financial dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to analyze revenue, expenses, and key performance indicators.

## CFO Level Financial Metrics

### Overview
This is my first financial dashboard developed using Tableau.

### Description
This project, “CFO Level Financial Metrics”, provides an executive financial overview based on historical company data. I analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) including Gross Margin, Operating Margin, and Return on Assets (ROA).
The analysis includes a comparison of this year versus last year, highlighting changes in profitability and operational efficiency. I also reviewed the Income Statement in detail, identifying key drivers of revenue, expenses, and net profit.
This overview delivers clear insights into the company’s financial performance and trends, helping to evaluate growth and efficiency at the CFO level.
