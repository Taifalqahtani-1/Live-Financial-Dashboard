# Live-Financial-Dashboards
I built financial dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to analyze revenue, expenses, and key performance indicators.

## Assessment Note
I completed the Tarmeez Capital assessment by creating two interactive dashboards (Tableau & Power BI) with key financial metrics, stock trends, employee data, and insights. All work meets the assessment requirements and is submitted before the deadline.

### Overview
This is my first live financial dashboard developed using Tableau.

### Description
This project, “CFO Level Financial Metrics”, provides an executive financial overview based on historical company data. I analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) including Gross Margin, Operating Margin, and Return on Assets (ROA).
The analysis includes a comparison of this year versus last year, highlighting changes in profitability and operational efficiency. I also reviewed the Income Statement in detail, identifying key drivers of revenue, expenses, and net profit.
This overview delivers clear insights into the company’s financial performance and trends, helping to evaluate growth and efficiency at the CFO level.

### Key Insights
- Gross Margin improved to 40.4% (+0.6%), indicating stronger cost control and improved efficiency in managing production costs.
- Operating Margin increased to 20.5% (+0.6%), reflecting enhanced operational performance and better expense management.
- Return on Assets (ROA) slightly declined to 8.6% (-0.2%), suggesting a minor decrease in asset utilization efficiency.
- Revenue reached $64.4B, generating a Gross Profit of $26.0B and Net Income of $9.4B, demonstrating solid overall profitability.
- The Net Income trend shows noticeable improvement in several months compared to last year, highlighting positive financial momentum.
